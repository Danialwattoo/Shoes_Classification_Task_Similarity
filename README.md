# Shoes_Classification_Task_Similarity

## Project Overview

The **Shoes Classification Task Similarity** project focuses on classifying images of shoes into various categories using machine learning. The core of this project is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to preprocess images, train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and evaluate its performance.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classify images of shoes into categories such as sneakers, boots, and sandals.
- **Model Training**: Train a CNN model using the provided dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the modelâ€™s performance with evaluation metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the machine learning tasks.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Libraries for building and training the CNN model.
- **OpenCV/PIL**: Libraries for image processing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for running and visualizing the code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
